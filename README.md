#  🔭 Newtonian Telescope Moving Project
This project is focused on designing and building a motorized moving system for a Newtonian reflector telescope. The goal is to provide precise, smooth, and automated movement of the telescope to track celestial objects across the night sky.

## Project Includes
	🧭 Tracking System – Automated tracking of stars and planets using calculated celestial coordinates.
	🎛️ Motor Control with 3D Telescope – Stepper/servo motors for accurate positioning and smooth movement.
	💻 Software Integration – Control via 3D Animations (e.g.,Python/ Node JS) with user-friendly commands.
	🌌 Astronomy Focused – Optimized for Newtonian reflector telescopes, balancing portability, accuracy, and ease of use.
